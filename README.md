# PREDICTION-STAY-OF-LENGTH-OF-STAY-FOR-PATHENT-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

The aim of this project is to predict the length of stay of patient in a hospital. In this 
covid-19 pandemic every hospital are facing resources problem. Because a huge number of 
patient are admitted every day and it is very difficult to manage all the medical resources in 
the hospital. So if the management know the length of stay of a patient then it will be very 
easy to manage all the medical resources.
The main objective of this project is to help the hospital management to manage all 
the resources in the hospital. Here we develop a program that predicts the stay length of a 
patient in a hospital by calculating related information of a patient from the dataset.
